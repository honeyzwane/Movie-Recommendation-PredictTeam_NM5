# Movie-Recommendation-PredictTeam_NM5

for this project EDSA has challenged Team NM5 to develop a recommendation algorithm, using either content-based or collaborative filtering, that can predict a user's rating for a movie they haven't seen yet based on their past preferences. A functional recommender system can provide significant economic value by exposing users to content they are likely to enjoy or purchase, thereby increasing revenue and user loyalty.
